        <h3>Moving Around</h3>
        <p>Because of my dad's travelling job when I was younger, I got to live in a lot of cool of cool places. Originally I was born in Mckinney Texas, where I lived for about a year and a half. I then moved briefly to India for four months, and then Vancouver for six months. Then we settled in West Palm Beach, Florida for almost two years before fully settling in Texas after. Now my family resides in Texas, while I moved to New York City for studying.</p>
