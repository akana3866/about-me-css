        <h3>Thrill Addiction</h3>
        <p>Some things that a lot of people don't know about me is that I love doing thrill related activites. So usually when I go travelling with my family I try to do one cool adventure sport or thrill related activity. Some of the cool things I have done in the past includes scuba diving, jet skiing, parasailling and more. The next thing on my bucket list is skiing and snowboarding :)</p>

        <h3>Culture</h3>
        <p>I am not the most religious person however, I am super connected to my culture and love to celebrate that. When I was younger up until high school I particpated in bollywood dance and did several performances for popular religious events. I also go every year to celebrate Diwali, Garba, and Holi with my friends and family. I also occasionally enjoy binging bollywood movies and music. Living in india I am also somewhat fluent in speaking and understanding hindi which further connects me back to my homeland! </p>

        <h3>Other Random Things</h3>
        <p>Some other random things that might be cool to know is that when I was younger I loved music and learned to play the piano, clarinet, and was in choir. I also loved sports therefore, I joined a swimming team and taekwando for a brief period of my life before fully commiting to tennis.</p>
